# AutoRepoSync
AutoRepoSync automates repo creation and synchronization between a personal repo and an organization. When a push occurs on a specific branch, it checks if the target repo exists in the orgâ€”if not, it creates one. It then pushes updates to the designated branch, ensuring seamless mirroring and continuous sync. ðŸ”„âœ¨
